                During my time at the UEA I have learnt various programming skills and languages, project planning, working to a specification and time management. Modules taken include: Software Engineering, AI, Machine Learning, Database Systems, Audio-Visual Processing, Analogue and Digital Electronics, Graphics as well as Programming and Data Structures and Algorithms. Some examples of coursework include: AI chatbot, using NLP within a Flask framework, Speech recogniser and lip reader using Hidden Markov models, board game booking system using Django, and building a 2D platform game in OpenGL.

                I achieved awards for distinguished performance in my foundation and first year, finished my second year with an average grade of 78.56% and am on track to achieve something similar in my final year

                <p>After completing the first year of my undergraduate degree I was accepted onto a 13 week app development internship along with four other students. As a team we followed the SCRUM framework, and in the 13 week period we were allocated, we managed to deliver a high quality working prototype to the product owner. This internship has given me invaluable experience working with React Native, as well as working within a team using the SCRUM framework and using other project management tools such as Jira and Trello. </p>
